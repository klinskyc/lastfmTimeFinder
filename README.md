lastfmTimeFinder
================

Uses last.fm to see how long you've spent listening to music.

## Instructions

This script requires my fork of the last fm ruby plugin, you can find it  at https://github.com/klinskyc/ruby-lastfm

1. Install that gem (it fixes encoding and returns more information)
2. Edit the script to have your username (replace cklinsky68 with your desired username)
3. Run the script (e.g ruby lastfm.rb)
